      <description>This post was first published on the website of the Leiden Center for Innovation Online Learning Lab.
Leiden University runs a variety of different Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Over the past two years, it has produced 11 iterations of 6 unique MOOCs, and further moved Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice (as one of an initial 73 courses) to Coursera’s new on-demand platform. Each one of these courses generates a wealth of behavioral data by which we can evaluate teaching methods, improve on-campus education, and offer a platform for academic research to investigate learning behavior of students with different educational and cultural backgrounds.</description>
