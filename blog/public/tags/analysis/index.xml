      <description>This article was written by Miika Korja just before Finland&amp;rsquo;s national elections on 19 April 2015. Most of the content is still very relevant, and discusses the impact of Russia&amp;rsquo;s behaviour in the international arena on the NATO debate in Finland. 
In 2012 the Commander of the Russian Armed Forces General Nikolai Makarov, publicly advised Finland not to become a member of NATO, as this would render a security threat for Russia.</description>

      <description>Data and scripts available upon request

I happened to have access to BoardEx, a high-quality database that contains a lot of information on corporate boards and their board members, so I wrote a little script to scrape all the data about S&amp;amp;P500 board members.</description>
