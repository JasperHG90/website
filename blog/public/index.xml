      <description>qualtRics version 2.0 is now available from CRAN. This version contains several additional features and simplifies the process of importing survey exports from Qualtrics. Below, I outline the most important changes. You can check the full changelog here.
qualtRics configuration file In previous versions, users needed to register their API key by calling the registerApiKey() function to avoid having to pass it to each function. However, they did need to pass the root url to each function, which is annoying and inconsistent.</description>

      <description>This guide is part of a series on setting up your own private server running shiny apps. There are many guides with great advice on how to set up an R shiny server and related software. I try to make a comprehensive guide based in part on these resources as well as my own experiences. I always aim to properly attribute information to their respective sources. If you notice an issue, please contact me.</description>

      <description>Qualtrics allows users to collect online data through surveys. My R package qualtRics contains convenience functions to pull survey results straight into R using the Qualtrics API instead of having to download survey results manually.
Currently, the package contains three functions:
 getSurveys() fetches a list of all surveys that you own or have access to from Qualtrics. getSurvey() downloads a survey from Qualtrics and loads it into R. readSurvey() allows you to read CSV files you download manually from Qualtrics.</description>

      <description>Last week, I came across sparklyr. Authored by the folks at rstudio, it allows you to integrate your R workflow (and, more importantly, your dplyr workflow) with apache spark. In one of the examples on the sparklyr home page, the author shows how to set up rstudio and sparklyr on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (ECC). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share how you can set up your own rstudio/apache cluster environment using Google dataproc.</description>

      <description>For me, one of the most interesting areas of data analytics is in processing text as data. Because texts are created by humans, they tend to be difficult to interpret, biased, error-prone and idiosyncratic. This is exactly what makes text interesting as a source of data. In the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project that involves analyzing annual reports of U.S. firms. After scraping the 10-K reports from the SEC website (using this R package), we extract the business description section of each report.</description>
