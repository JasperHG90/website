<em>This article was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/miika-korja/ab/38b/30" target="_blank">Miika Korja</a> just before Finland's national elections on 19 April 2015. Most of the content is still very relevant, and discusses the impact of Russia's behaviour in the international arena on the NATO debate in Finland. </em>

In 2012 the Commander of the Russian Armed Forces General Nikolai Makarov, publicly advised Finland not to become a member of NATO, as this would render a security threat for Russia. Russia is one of the most strategic trade partners of Finland, and writers such as Neil MacFarquhar of <em>The New York Times</em> argue that Finland has avoided joining NATO not to agitate Moscow. However, the ravaging war in Ukraine produces security concerns for Finland that warrants entry into a security formation like NATO provides. Has the '<em>Russian Bear'</em> truly become more concerned about its sphere of influence lately, or has Western media also contributed to these security concerns?

In the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea in February 2014, NATO support in Finland skyrocketed from 18% to 34% in a mere two months. In February 2015, the support was measured at 27%. This fluctuation is remarkable given past historical measures. For instance, after the Russo-Georgian war in 2008 Finnish NATO support stayed low and stable, measured in September 2008 at 23%. Public support for NATO membership in Finland plays a crucial role, as the Members of Parliament, Ministers, Prime Minister and the President have clearly communicated that Finland will not join NATO without a referendum. According to President Sauli Niinisto, for example, "If we [the Finns] are in a situation where the government and the President -- whoever they that time may be -- would propose [NATO membership], we must carry out a referendum".

What causes public opinion to shift with Finnish public NATO support? Political scientists cherish the saying, 'Constants do not cause change'. That is, public opinion does not simply <em>change</em>, there must be a force driving this change. In the context of public opinion, the scholarly field <em>agenda-setting</em> seeks to explain how media's reporting influences public opinion and government policy, and vice versa. In the 1960s Bernard Cohen claimed that the press "may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think <em>about</em>". Agenda-setting literature could help explain, for example, why public awareness on issues such as climate change often happens in cycles. Frequently the causal link is found from media reporting and policy agendas.

Why has public NATO support suddenly skyrocketed in Finland in the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, but stayed low and stable during the Russo-Georgian war? Three contrasting views from academic literature could explain a public opinion shift during two conflicts that were similar in nature, and exhaustively covered by media. First, the geopolitical concerns for Finland of the Ukraine crisis were greater than those of the Russo-Georgian war. Second, the Finnish government had driven a stronger pro-NATO agenda during the Ukraine crisis than during the Russo-Georgian war. And third, Finnish media had reported and framed the conflicts differently.

From Finland's strategic position during the two conflicts, incentives of political parties to push for NATO agenda, as well as media agenda-setting, there is suggestive evidence that Finnish media has engaged in more pro-NATO framing during the Russo-Georgian war (see figure 1) than during the Ukraine crisis.

Evidence conspicuously indicates that Finnish media has reported about the 'Russian threat' more frequently and intensely during the Ukraine crisis than during the Russo-Georgian war, but the reasons and incentives to do so remain unclear (see figure 2). There was no evidence that parties and elites had caused this change in reporting. Instead, the slightly different characters of the conflicts could have contributed to the different framing of the Ukraine crisis in Finland.

The upcoming Finnish parliamentary elections in April 2015 are anticipated to stir discussion about NATO and hence, possibly generate even more fluctuation in public NATO support. In tandem with the elections and the ongoing war in Ukraine, a small and scarce policy window might emerge in Finland. The new government could potentially take advantage of this momentum to amend Finland's NATO policy in the short-run.

To borrow an anecdote by the former senior advisor to the US President, Rahm Emanuel: "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. (...) This [2008 financial] crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not before". If Finland suddenly decided to seize the opportunity and pursue its plans with NATO membership, even Sweden could possibly jump on the bandwagon and also apply for the membership. Especially in early 2015, Finland and Sweden have emphasised their cooperation regarding future defence alliances.

Recalling media's influence on public opinion, Finnish media's reporting and framing of the NATO discussion will likely be of paramount importance with the up-coming elections in April. This pertains especially to <em>Helsingin Sanomat</em>; the largest subscription newspaper in Finland and in the Nordic countries. How they frame the upcoming NATO discussion -- as found in my study -- can have strong impact on Finnish public NATO support.

Finland and Sweden's NATO membership could potentially have substantial implications with Russia's relationship with the West. If Finland joins NATO, the alliance's land border with Russia will be doubled. A new international nexus of political dispute could emerge in the Nordic Countries, which arguably lie in the proximity of Russia's sphere of interests. It remains to be seen how such radical Eastern expansion of NATO would be framed in the Russian mainstream state media, and what Russia's reaction would be.

Observers of the elections should stay vigilant to a couple of things. How will Finnish media frame the return of <em>Russian Bear</em> when reporting about the war in Ukraine? Will Finnish political parties communicate transparently their NATO stances? And finally, which parties will form the new government coalition?
